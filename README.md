### Algorithms and data structures (mostly in Python 3.8)
This is where i'm putting stuff when preparing my classes. So, it may be unorganized and code may not be a finished product.

It's only me trying to create an easy way to explain things.

That said, you can do what ever you want with any code in here (you may test it and change it for yout needs).
